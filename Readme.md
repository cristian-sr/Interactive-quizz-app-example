# Interactive Quiz App - Example

This is the last of our intermediate HTML projects, and it’s a great chance to extend yourself before tackling the more advanced projects we’ve provided.

The main goal here is to create a dynamic and interactive quiz. 

We’ll be presenting the user with a series of questions, and we’ll be providing immediate feedback on their answers. To do this, we’ll be using some JavaScript.

We’ll also be using Bootstrap in this project. The further you go in web development, the more you’ll see CSS frameworks being used, so it doesn’t hurt to get even more practice. 

Without a doubt, this HTML project is another step up in complexity, so let’s look at the different skills you’ll be using to tackle it:

- HTML5: Structuring the quiz page content with semantic HTML5.
- JavaScript: Using JS to manage the quiz logic, event handling, and DOM manipulation.
- Bootstrap: Using Bootstrap components for a polished UI with modals and buttons.
- CSS: Styling the quiz interface and layout while including a responsive design.

So, while it may seem quite simple, this project is a great chance to test out the skills you’ve honed in the previous projects in a new way.

If I had to pick one stand-out feature of this project, it’s probably the greater use of JavaScript to provide immediate user feedback.

We’ll also be using JS to handle user input, validate answers, and keep their score.

As we move on to the more advanced HTML projects, you’ll see that we have no choice but to make greater use of JavaScript.

The TL-DR is that when you reach a certain level, the natural extension is to include interactivity. And right now, JavaScript is the best and most popular way to do this.

Let’s take a look at the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript source code for our quiz app.

You’ll notice that the HTML code itself is not very long! That’s because we’re using JavaScript to dynamically output questions one by one.

This is quite similar to the Single Page Application (SPA) approach that you tend to see when building with React. Just check out any React course to see what I mean.

Overall, if you have your heart set on becoming a pro web developer, this is good to know! 

You’ll also see that our CSS file is relatively short, as we’re relying a lot on Bootstrap for its default styling. This is not uncommon when building with a CSS framework.

Finally, the JS source code is definitely the longest we’ve included so far!

Don’t be daunted by this, as it’s not super technical or complicated. Overall, we have some event listeners, a function to serve up questions, and a function to process a user's answer.

Note also that right now, I’ve only added one question. You might want to add to this!

Similarly, as I’ve said throughout, now’s also the time to experiment with this code and to test yourself.

Try something different with Bootstrap, see if you can improve the JS code, and make some changes to the HTML. Whatever you do, just have fun with it!

These projects are designed to help you learn new skills and showcase them, but they’re also designed to let you try new things and express yourself as a web developer.

So have fun, and get creative!
